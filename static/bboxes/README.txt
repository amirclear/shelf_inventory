Bounding Box Result Images
==========================

Place placeholder images here for the detection results display.

Required files:
- shelf1_bbox.jpg  (for shelf1 detections)
- shelf2_bbox.jpg  (for shelf2 detections)
- shelf3_bbox.jpg  (for shelf3/mixed detections)
- unknown.jpg      (for unknown/other detections)

These can be simple placeholder images (colored rectangles, sample images, etc.)
for MVP demonstration purposes. The app will display these when showing detection results.

The images should be in JPG format and will be displayed in the detection results page.
